# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the result of my practice with HTML, CSS3, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as Node and Express back-end skills.

Tweeter is responsive to desktop and tablet/mobile sizing. It features form toggling on the nav-bar, as well as a "scroll to top" button.

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the npm install command).
- Run the development web server (using the npm run local command).
- Point your browser to localhost:8080 and start creating some tweets!
